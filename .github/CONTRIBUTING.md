#### Application Review Process on GitHub

- Once you’ve received the issue assigned to yourself, you’ll use GitHub just to track the progress, but the whole process will be carried out using the event tracker and HelpScout [as usual](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/resources-and-tools/application-review/). - - - Please never share your vetting notes on GitHub, only in the event tracker as we always do.
