#### Application Review Process on GitHub

> Once you’ve received the issue assigned to yourself, you’ll use GitHub just to track the progress, but the whole process will be carried out using the event tracker and HelpScout [as usual](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/resources-and-tools/application-review/). - - - Please never share your vetting notes on GitHub, only in the event tracker as we always do.

* Update the status to In Progress
* If you need a second opinion or help from teammates, while you wait for their feedback please update the status to In Review
* If you need, you can leave a comment on the issue:


- Once you’ve completed the entire application review process: tracker updated and email sent to organizer for inviting to orientation or reject the application, please update the status to Complete, scroll the page until the bottom, and close the issue.
