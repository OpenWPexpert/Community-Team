        ## Next steps

        - [ ] Please assign the issue to the team member and make sure to mark the issue ```To Do```
        - [ ] Assignee (Team Member) will mark the issue as ```In Progress``` and perform the vetting taks on the tracker and HS as indicated on the handbook
        - [ ] Once the vetting is completed mark the issue as ```In Review```

        ## Public vs Private

        - Use comments for questions about the process and changes or to indicate delays, holding situation.
        - Avoid discussing the community or the organiser in comments on Github. Even if there are doubts about some applications.
        - We do not post vetting notes publicly and ensure such notes are strictly in the tracker or HelpScout.
